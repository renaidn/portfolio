                Hello and welcome to my portfolio! 
                <br><br>
              </p>
              <p>
                <!-- <br><br> -->
                My name is Adina and I am currently a junior at 
                NYU Abu Dhabi majoring in Interactive Media and
                minoring in Psychology and Sound & Music
                Computing. Although I am still in the early stages 
                of my UX design journey, I am passionate about 
                learning and creating user-centered designs that 
                prioritize usability and accessibility.
                <br><br>
                I have always been interested in technology and 
                design, and I am excited to combine these 
                interests in my studies and future career as a UX 
                designer. I am actively seeking opportunities to
                 gain hands-on experience and build my skills in 
                 the field, including participating in design 
                 thinking workshops and internships.
                <br><br>
                Through my coursework and extracurricular 
                activities, I have gained a strong foundation in 
                building low and high fidelity wireframes, front 
                end web development, sound and graphic design, 
                and am constantly seeking to expand my 
                knowledge and skills in the field. I am eager to 
                apply what I have learned and continue learning 
                in real-world projects and situations.
                <!-- <br><br> -->
                <!-- Thank you for visiting my portfolio. While it is still 
                a work in progress, I hope you enjoy exploring my 
                work and learning more about my design process. 
                Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have
                any questions or if you'd like to discuss a potential 
                project. -->

                <!-- I am have great interest crafting optimal solutions and dynamic
                user experience I have some experience in the fields of
                front-end web development, branding and marketing, design
                (logotypes, posters, invites), video editing, and space
                management. My special interest lies in accessibility design
                research, on which I will be focusing in my capstone project. My

                  For this project me and my friend teamed up to make a game
                  inspired by many collaborative games we have played together
                  (It Takes Two, A Way Out, Pico Park). The game we were looking
                  to make was a two player game, where players would be required
                  to work as a team to clear a level.

                  Not Parkour is an arcade style collaborative 2 player game.
                  Levels are structured in such way that players won't be able
                  to complete the level on their own. Players can either create
                  the room or join one, where they will be assigned a character
                  at random. Each of the characters have their own special
                  ability. Agash is a tree that jumps high. Kyzyl is a mushroom
                  with a very bouncy hat that can be used as a trampoline by
                  Agash. They join their forces to collect the keys and escape
                  from the dark castle.

                <p>
                  We have started from building a basic grid (map) to store the
                  information about the placement of the game blocks. We then
                  added a square (the player character), which moved with WASD
                  and spacebar, added the gravity, and some collision functions.
                  Collisions were a bit tricky to handle. It took a bunch of for
                  loops and if statements. For some reason, lower boundary of
                  the game blocks did not work and the user would go through
                  them whenever they jumped below a block.

                <legend>why pixel art?</legend>
                <p>
                  For the design, we initially considered staying with the grid
                  style adapted from our sketches. However, we have quickly
                  realized that lack of character could potentially make it
                  harder for the user to connect with their game character. We
                  needed to come up with a user friendly design that would feel
                  inviting and in a way traditional for web games. For this
                  purpose, pixel art style felt like a great choice. It's
                  deceivingly simple looking style makes its viewers believe
                  that the game must be just as simple. Pixel art is pretty
                  concise, yet detailed enough to give the game some character.

                  I was fully in charge of the game design. To make each of the
                  blocks needed for the game I have used Adobe Illustrator. This
                  project marks my first attempt at pixel art. After some tries
                  and errors, I have settled on 24*24 grid, which felt like I
                  could add the just right amount of details to make block
                  features recongizable, yet not oversaturated with details. I
                  had fun with this step and found the process to be quite
                  therapeutic.

                <legend>what makes a game?</legend>
                <p>
                  As we have finished working on level designs and the main game
                  logic, we have moved onto an important question: "What makes a
                  gaming experience?". We wanted to create an experience that
                  would feel well-thought-out to the users. That required some
                  careful research and planning on our end. After all, we only
                  had a month to bring our game to life. After some
                  consideration, we have identified pause screen, game server
                  window, a waiting room, and appropriate sound effects to be
                  important additions to the game. I have designed those
                  elements and spaces, while Shyngys added necessary code for
                  those elements to function properly. Adding sound to the game
                  was important for me, because I believe that sound is a
                  powerful tool. It is relatively simple but extremely effective
                  way of making a piece feel more thoughtful and impactful.
                  Incorporation of these aforementioned elements allowed the
                  game to feel more full-fledged and finished.

                  Working on this project I was once again reminded of the
                  importance of team-work and active communication. This and
                  planning ahead have made this game possible! I have discovered
                  the beauty of pixel art through this project and as you may
                  have noticed from my portfolio carried this style into my

                  looking forward to creating more interactive web applications!

                  I have been working as a UX designer alongside 2 front-end and 2 back-end developers. 
                  My role was to produce high fidelity wireframes for desktop and mobile versions of the 
                  website based on references and requirements provided by the organization. These were 
                  mostly guidlines regarding the information, functionality, and pages that were needed 
                  to be included in the website.

                <p>
                  I have joined the project almost a month after the project have started, so there 
                  already was a foundation of the website by the time I have joined. Since we were tight 
                  on the deadline, I have decided that the best decision would be building upon elements 
                  that already exist. <br><br>
                  I have worked on identifying the issues with existing design and focused on resolving 
                  them. The main issue was the lack of consistency in each elements individually and as a
                  part of the bigger group. On the landing pages alone there were 16 different font sizes.
                  In my wireframes I have specified all of the measurements and sticked to the 8 point
                  grid and limited the font sizes to 3 max. This along has brought significant improvement 
                  to the website.

                  I have settled on the blue and white color palette with orange as an accent color. This 
                  has given the website a traditionally
                  "medical" look that is recongizable at a first sight. I have tried making the website
                  elements as easy to navigate as possible, because the target audience of the website
                  ranges from 30 to 65 years old. From my personal experience, these age groups do 
                  experience difficulties navigating non-traditional websites. In this project, creative
                  approach to element design, website layout, and user interactions would not be suitable
                  for the target audience and the purposes of the website. Comfortable and intuitive are the
                  adjectives that best describe the experience that I was looking to create.

                  Since I have joined the project later
                  than others, I have missed out on initial communication with the client, which I 
                  personally find very important, and which could potentially expedite the design process as
                  I would have a better understanding of client's wishes and wants.
                  I have communicated closely with the developers, which helped me 
                  understand my designs and choices better.
                  Overall,his project have taught me acting fast in situations of crisis and quickly adapting to

                  One of the requirements for this project was actively using the data fetched from

                  I have always found them to have a nostalgic appeal, which makes them less intimidating
                  and actually quite inviting to use. This has led me to my project proposal.

                <p>
                  I wanted to create a wholesome online drawing experience for those who can't 
                  use special professional drawing programs but want to start exploring digital 
                  drawing. <br> <br>
                  Middle school me would have been happy to find a program of this kind, because 
                  my laptop wasn't powerful enough to support graphic softwares, but I had a deep 
                  interest in digital art. Even though online drawing websites frequently have a 
                  rather limited functionality, it was a great starting point for me to pursue my 
                  interest and familiarize myself with a tricky drawing-with-your-mouse experience.

                  As I have added all of the envisioned functionality to the page, I have realized
                  that there are better ways of organizing and presenting those functions. I have worked
                  on finding a balance between representing crayola colors and providing an
                  uncompromised drawing experience. I have made sure that every element on display is
                  self-explanatory and functional. While two icons have dropdown menus on hover (canvas 
                  size, canvas orientation), I have decided put out all of the brushes options directly
                  on display for the user to be aware of all of the tools options present.

                  I decided to explore the human / robot relationships through this identity. 
                  Specifically, I wanted this design to communicate the unique connection, the 
                  incredible exchange of information, and the productivity of these relationships, 
                  while also remembering about the fundamental differences between the humans and 
                  the robots, all of this delivered through one visual identity.

                  Setting this ambitious goal, my starting point was the imagery of a handshake. 
                  An almost universal gesture of positive and welcoming interaction. So incredibly 
                  overused, but at the same time so very fitting for our goals. At first, I was 
                  hesitant about using this gesture, however this hesitation was gone after I 
                  stumbled upon Michelangelo’s “creation of Adam”. The iconic fingers reaching for 
                  each other. We can almost see an electric spark glimmering there. Beautiful and 
                  very inspiring moment.

                <p>
                  I am not a painter nor a photographer. I am a logo designer, who have shapes and 
                  colors as our tools. And I gladly utilized these tools in my sketches. I have 
                  started from detailed ./images and reduced the amount of details till I was able 
                  to catch this beautiful moment of connection. The robot hand finally meets the 
                  human hand and at the intersection of the handshake something new is being 
                  created.

                <p>
                  As the shapes in this design are abstract and minimal, the color scheme plays an 
                  essential role in highlighting the intersection of two hands and hence is key to 
                  the successful communication of its idea. For this reason, I found it important to
                  address the design accessibility, specifically color blindness friendly palettes,
                  in this logo design. Below are a few design iterations that I have came up with
                  after learning more about most common types of color blindness and experimenting 
                  with high contrast color pairings.

                  Cosimo is a clothing brand by Cosimo Ippolito based in London with a DNA of Italian 
                  craftsmanship. The brand's motto positions it in a circular way, “stories beyond 
                  design, design beyond stories”. It takes pride in it's sewing technique, aguglia,
                  which translates as the "garfish" or the "sea needle" from Italian language.

                  The few concepts that I want my logo proposal to focus on are sewing and aguglia. I
                  find these two to be the unique selling points integral tothe brand identity of 
                  Cosimo. I also need to keep in mind that Cosimo is a clothing brand, so the final 
                  design must look like clear and recognizable on the clothes.

                <p>
                  Above you can see some of the possible design proposal for the logo. In all of my 
                  designs, I have used the long and sleek shape of the aguglia fish to make a letter ‘C’. I 
                  then played with the angles and the widths to create some variations of this design. 
                  <br><br>
                  As you can see, the two designs in the left column have an additional detail to make them 
                  resemble the needle eye. This way I am communicating both concepts: aguglia, and sewing.
                  <br><br>
                  The two designs on their right, on the other hand, only communicate the aguglia fish and 
                  have the upper part of their edge split into two to make it look like its mouth. I don’t 
                  favor these two variations, because they are too abstract and resemble a snake more than 
                  a fish. On the good side, they made me think of brands like Lacoste, PUMA, and Polo Ralph 
                  Lauren. These clothing brands have various animals illustrated in their logos and I have 
                  realized that I can do the same. For some reason, I occasionally forget that minimalism and 
                  abstraction are not the only ways to go for in a design. With this in mind, I have came up
                  with the image of detailed but not too much aguglia and presented it as the final logo 
                  proposal. 
                </p>

                <p>
                  I actually am happy with the way this design turned out. I think it would have looked good 
                  as an embroidery and perhaps there are a way of transforming it into a seamless monogram.
                  I would have explored more presentation options if we were given more time to actually
                  work on and develop our proposal before presenting them.
